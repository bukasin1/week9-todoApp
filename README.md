# todo-app

The task is to build a Todo App. You are to use Node.js, Express and MongoDB for the backend. You are free to use any client side framework or Templating Engine to handle the view part.

The Todo App is to have the following core functions: 
* A user should be able to create a todo
* A user should be able to view all todos
* A user should be able to get individual todos
* A user should be able to edit a particular todo
* A user should be able to delete a todo

You should also Write Unit Tests

Optional Stuff:
* Add authentication so a user needs to be logged in before creating, editing and deleting a todo
* Add authorization to ensure a user cannot edit or delete a todo that was not created by him or her
* Add searching so a user can filter the list of all todos by the search criteria
